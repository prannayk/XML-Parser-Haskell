So I was sitting in the library thinking to myself how I could set up a blog without setting up a database or a sign in or anything of the sort. And then I realized all I had to do was write a code which parsed a XML file where I set up my blog and put it into an HTML file with the proper formatting and all. And with that code I could auto-generate static pages I could push to my github repository allowing me to create a blog. The next question was how would I be writing this parser. The obvious answer would be python. But that would be too mainstream so I decided to go with Haskell since Haskell is what would allow me to learn the most. And also cuz I love programming functionally. So that is it for now. Now let us hope this works as it is supposed to and I dont waste all the time I have trying to code something that would defeat the purpose in the end. </blog-text></blogentry>
